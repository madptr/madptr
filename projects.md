### Simply CPP
A repository of useful code snippets for C++ beginners doesn't count as a project, still, it will be a useful reference for devs who are new to C++, especially in the game/graphics dev community. [GitHub link](https://github.com/madptr/SimplyCpp)\
Some explanatory posts can be found [here](https://madptr.com/tags/SimplyCpp).
