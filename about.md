# Hi there !

My name is Abilash Joseph Rajarethinam.

I'm a teacher, a game/graphics programmer and a bunch of other stuff. As a kid, I was fascinated by computers and enjoyed writing tiny programs on BASIC. After many years and numerous detours and U-turns, I still am making teeny tiny programs. One important detour landed me in a teaching job where I had to teach computer science and later I went on to teach games development where I learnt a lot more about computer graphics than about making games. \
This website has nothing but my rant on computer graphics, programming, and any other stuff that I've got an interest in.
