Hi there! My name is Abilash Joseph Rajarethinam.

I'm a teacher, a programmer, and an independent game developer with a lot of interest in computer graphics. As a kid, I enjoyed creating tiny programs. After many detours and U-turns, I'm making teeny tiny programs again. One of the detours landed me in a teaching job where I had to teach computer science and later I consciously chose to teach games development. There, I learned a lot more about computer graphics than about making games. To date, computer graphics and the way our programs interact with the GPU and the working of the GPU itself blows my mind. This website has nothing but my rant on computer graphics, programming, and any other stuff that I've got an interest in.
